Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

Great job with your comments, too.  Well done.

There is one efficiency that could be added.  Notice that
every time you call malt(), you call house() immediately afterwards.
Therefore, you could add house() at the end of your malt() method, and
remove it from the verse methods.  Then, you could do the same thing
with rat() (add malt() at the end of it), etc.  Your verse7() function,
then, would have just your first printed line, and the cow()
method, and everything else would happen automatically.
